Title: Top Scoring Pairs for Microarray Classification
Version: 1.25.0
Author: Jeffrey T. Leek <jtleek@jhu.edu>
Description: These functions calculate the pair of genes that show the
        maximum difference in ranking between two user specified
        groups. This "top scoring pair" maximizes the average of
        sensitivity and specificity over all rank based classifiers
        using a pair of genes in the data set. The advantage of
        classifying samples based on only the relative rank of a pair
        of genes is (a) the classifiers are much simpler and often more
        interpretable than more complicated classification schemes and
        (b) if arrays can be classified using only a pair of genes, PCR
        based tests could be used for classification of samples. See
        the references for the tspcalc() function for references
        regarding TSP classifiers.
